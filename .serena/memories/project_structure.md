# Repository Structure Plan
- `docs/` â€“ planning artifacts (project overview, requirements, tech stack, architecture, tickets).
- Planned directories: `front/` (web client), `backend/` (future APIs), `ops/` (deployment/CI scripts).
- `.serena/project.yml` tracks TypeScript project metadata.
- Structure emphasizes clear separation so contributors can find front/back/ops areas quickly.
