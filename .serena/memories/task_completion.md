# Task Completion Checklist
- Confirm implementation aligns with project purpose (joyful, science-backed learning loops) and ticket acceptance criteria.
- Run pnpm commands: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm test`, relevant Playwright smoke; note any skips if tooling unfinished.
- Update documentation (`docs/` and `docs/tickets.md`) with status, decisions, and caregiver/child experience considerations.
- Provide summary of changes, testing results, and next recommended steps when reporting back to user.
